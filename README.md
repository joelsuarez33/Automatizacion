## 📂 Project structure

- `Script_SAP.py`: base script to connect and interact with SAP via scripting.
- Inside this script, you can insert the `.vbs` code generated by recording a manual process in SAP.

## ✅ What you can automate

✔️ Mass extraction from transactions (e.g., **FBL1N**, **MB51**)  
✔️ Automated form filling and navigation  
✔️ Data input from **Excel to SAP**  
✔️ Report customization and download  
✔️ Daily/monthly routine operations (e.g., invoice processing)

## 🚀 How to use it

1. **Enable scripting in SAP GUI**  
   - Go to: `SAP GUI Options > Accessibility & Scripting > Scripting`
   - Ensure scripting is enabled both client-side and server-side.

2. **Record the process**  
   - In SAP: `Customizing > Script Recording and Playback`
   - Perform the task manually and export the `.vbs` script.

3. **Adapt the `.vbs`**  
   - Clean up unnecessary lines  
   - Replace hardcoded values with variables  
   - You can use AI tools like ChatGPT or Copilot to help with this

4. **Insert adapted code into `Script_SAP.py`**  
   - Use `subprocess.run(...)` in Python to execute the `.vbs` logic

5. **Run the script from VS Code**
